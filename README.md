# hw_final
hi~ this is the repository where I commit some projects of two main_directions, data mining and graph algorithms.

## hw_applied_ml
Most projects here aim for solving a specific applied problem with classical machine learning like the form of competition in Kaggle.

## hw_research_ml
Some projects here focus on restruction of data and algorithms.

[community detection] compared the differences between traditional methods and graphrep in the scenaro of community detection.

[data mining] show the whole mining process from eda to training taking a easy binary classification as example.

[Deep GCN] included deep gcn such as GCNII, APPNP...

[PUlearning] study the solution when only positive sample is labeled.

Hope these can help u and if u have any suggestion for the projects, welcome!
